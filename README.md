## My process

I opted to create the background circles with CSS as opposed to using a static image. I enjoyed the challenge of forming and creating their shadows and adjusting their rotational positioning accordingly. Used flexbox for positioning and moved repetitive colors, font-weights/sizes, css-reset, and main body styles to SCSS values and sub-folders.
